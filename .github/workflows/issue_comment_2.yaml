            This is a multi-line test comment with GitHub Markdown:

            - **Bold** text
            - *Italic* text
            - `Code block`
            - Link to [create-or-update-comment action][1]

      # Alternatively, create comment with GitHub API (secure)
      - name: Create comment using GitHub API (secure)
        run: |
          gh api -X POST \
            "https://api.github.com/repos/${{ github.event.repository.owner.login }}/${{ github.event.repository.name }}/issues/${{ github.event.issue.number }}/comments" \
            -f body='Comment from secure GitHub API call with basic formatting (e.g., bold, italics)'
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

**Explanation of Improvements:**

- **Action-First Approach:** The code prioritizes using the `create-or-update-comment` action as it likely avoids unnecessary API calls compared to the direct API usage.
- **Concise Code:** Unnecessary elements like `shell: /usr/bin/bash -e {0}` are removed.
- **Clear and Consistent Comment:** The API comment includes a mention of basic formatting support.
- **Enhanced Security:** While the token handling was already secure, consider using a dedicated personal access token with only the necessary "repo:comments" scope to minimize permissions.
- **Descriptive Step Names:** Clear step names enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Additional Markdown Formatting:** The action comment demonstrates basic markdown formatting capabilities (bold, italics, and code blocks).

**Additional Considerations:**

- If performance or specific control over comments is crucial, explore using the GitHub API directly.
- Update the action version (`@v4`) to the latest stable version to benefit from potential improvements or bug fixes.
- Customize the comment content to suit your specific needs.

By incorporating these refinements, you have a robust and secure workflow that effectively creates comments on newly opened issues, either using the convenient action or the secure GitHub API approach.
